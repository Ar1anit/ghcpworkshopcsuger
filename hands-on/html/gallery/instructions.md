## Inialize the project

First of all it is necessary to have a folder created in which you will create the project. Navigate to this folder via terminal and run the following command:

```bash
code .
```

Create an empty `index.html` file.

### Creating the HTML structure

Create an html file that has all the basic elements to get started with the gallery.

> [!Important]
> Use a comment as a prompt in your html file to initialize the project and then using the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in Visual Studio Code, you can view the html file in the browser.

> [!Tip]
> - You can use the following comment in your html file to initialize the project: ``<!-- very basic structure of a modern html page with head body etc -->``
> - There is also a shortcut to create the basic html structure in Visual Studio Code. Just type `!` and press `Tab` key.

### Solution

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>

</html>
```

You can have a look at your html file in the browser by right clicking on the file and selecting `Open with Live Server`.
