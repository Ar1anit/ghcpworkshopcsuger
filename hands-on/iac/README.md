## 💡 Pro Tips for Using Copilot with IaC

### 🎯 Effective Prompting Strategies
```
# Good prompts for Copilot:
# "Create a Terraform module for an AWS VPC with public and private subnets"
# "Generate Azure Bicep template for a web app with SQL database"
# "Add monitoring and alerting to this infrastructure"
```

### 🔍 Code Review Best Practices
- Always review generated code for security implications
- Validate resource configurations against cloud best practices
- Test in non-production environments first
