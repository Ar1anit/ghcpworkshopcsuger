```

## üìö Module-by-Module Instructions

### Module 1: Getting Started (45 minutes)
**Instructor Focus:**
- Emphasize the importance of good prompting
- Show live coding with Copilot
- Address common setup issues immediately

**Common Issues:**

2. Demonstrate comment-driven development
3. Explain when to accept vs. modify suggestions

### Module 2: Terraform Development (60 minutes)
**Instructor Focus:**
- Emphasize code organization principles
- Show module creation best practices
- Demonstrate variable validation

**Teaching Tips:**
- Walk through the module creation step-by-step
- Show how Copilot understands context between files
- Emphasize the importance of meaningful variable descriptions

**Time Management:**
- 20 min: Resource generation demo

- 15 min: Variables and outputs
- 5 min: Q&A and troubleshooting

### Module 3: Azure Templates (75 minutes)
**Instructor Focus:**
- Compare ARM vs. Bicep clearly
- Show template conversion techniques
- Emphasize Azure-specific best practices

**Demo Sequence:**
1. Generate ARM template with Copilot (10 min)
2. Convert to Bicep (10 min)
3. Add modules and parameters (15 min)
4. Guide through exercises (40 min)

**Common Questions:**
- "When to use ARM vs. Bicep?" ‚Üí Always prefer Bicep for new projects
- "How to handle existing ARM templates?" ‚Üí Convert gradually
- "What about Terraform vs. Bicep?" ‚Üí Explain use cases for each

### Module 4: Advanced Patterns (90 minutes)
**Instructor Focus:**
- Security-first approach
- Real-world architecture patterns
- Testing methodologies

**Critical Points:**
- Always review generated security configurations
- Explain the hub-and-spoke pattern clearly
- Show how to test infrastructure code

**Exercise Monitoring:**
- Walk around during hands-on exercises
- Help with complex networking concepts
- Ensure security best practices are followed

### Module 5: CI/CD Integration (75 minutes)
**Instructor Focus:**
- GitHub Actions workflow creation
- Secret management best practices
- Deployment strategies

**Live Demo Must-Haves:**
1. Complete workflow creation with Copilot
2. Show secret configuration in GitHub
3. Demonstrate plan vs. apply workflow

## üéØ Success Criteria

- How do you test infrastructure code?

**Module 5:**
- What are the key stages in an IaC pipeline?
- How do you handle secrets in GitHub Actions?

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Copilot Not Working:**
```bash
# Check extension status
code --list-extensions | grep copilot

# Restart VS Code
# Check GitHub Copilot subscription status
```

**Azure Authentication Issues:**
```bash
# Clear and re-authenticate
az logout
az login
az account show
```

**Terraform State Issues:**
```bash
# Initialize backend
terraform init
# Force unlock if needed
terraform force-unlock <lock-id>
```

**GitHub Actions Failures:**
- Check Azure credentials in secrets
- Verify Terraform syntax
- Review action logs carefully

## üìä Workshop Metrics

### Track These During Workshop
- Number of participants completing each module
- Common questions and issues
- Time spent on each exercise
- Participant feedback on difficulty

### Post-Workshop Survey Questions
