## Quick Tips on Model Selection

1. **Everyday Speed & Simplicity?**  
   Stick to **GPT-3.5 Turbo** or **O3-mini** for near real-time code suggestions on routine tasks.

2. **Balanced Performance for Complex Needs?**  
   **GPT-4o** or **Claude 3.5/3.7** offer a strong combination of high accuracy, large context, and reasonable speed.

3. **Deep Problem-Solving & Debugging?**  
   **OpenAI O1** (or **O3-mini** for coding-specific tasks) can handle intricate logic and step-by-step reasoning. Just be prepared for higher latency or usage limits.

4. **Massive Contexts or Enterprise Projects?**  
   **Claude 3.5/3.7** and **Google Gemini** both feature enormous context windows (100k+ tokens), with Gemini Flash supporting up to 1M tokens.

5. **Model Switching**  
   - It is often beneficial to switch models for specialized tasks (e.g., from GPT-4o to O1 for advanced debugging).  
   - Be aware of usage limits (especially for O1/O3-mini).  
   - Complex tasks may be slower on thorough models; use faster ones for routine completions.
